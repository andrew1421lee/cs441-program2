Number Game

This is literally a clone of 2048, so I decided to make it a Chinese clone. All the text in the game is now written in Chinese. Other than that, the game is nearly identical to the original!

## Other very cool features:
* The tiles change color programmatically!
* Gesture controlled!
* Score counter!
* There are animations for every action in the game! Moving tiles, combining tiles, spawning tiles, and the coolest animation: reseting the game!
* The Glorious Leader Chairman Mao will appear if you get a high enough score!
